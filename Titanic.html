      <h1>Titanic</h1>
    </font>
    <font color="00bd91" style="font-size:8px">
      <p>Titanic is an iconic movie that came out in 1997. The movie, featuring Leo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson (spoiler, in case you didn't see the background, he dies) and Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Titanic, is of course, a love story. However, while
        the sinking of the ship may have been romanticized, they did a good job at also highlighting the tragedy that was the titanic sinking. When the titanic sank in April of 1912, more than 1500 people died, whereas only 700 survived. There had been
        enough lifeboats on the titanic for just over half of the ship's population to survive, and yet less than a third lived. The movie didn't exactly highlight the heavy death toll, but to first time viewers of the movie they certainly made sure that
        the tragedy of the movie was known through the death of one of the main characters--Jack. Jack had only barely been able to make it onto the Titanic, having won the tickets off of someone while gambling. He then spent the rest of the movie charming
        Rose, who at the time was engaged. In the last half hour of the movie, Rose explained that Jack had died which the audience saw via flashback, and she had secretly taken his last name as her own to avoid her expectations amongst the wealthy. The
        movie finishes with an elderly Rose throwing her necklace into the sea. Celine Dion's song "My Heart Will Go On" is well known for being part of the Titanic sound track. Here are the lyrics (yes I am trying to make this paragraph really long):
        "Every night in my dreams I see you, I feel you That is how I know you go on Far across the distance And spaces between us You have come to show you go on Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door
        And you're here in my heart And my heart will go on and on Love can touch us one time And last for a lifetime And never let go 'til we're gone Love was when I loved you One true time I'd hold to In my life we'll always go on Near, far, wherever
        you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door And you're here in my heart And my heart will go on and on You're here, there's nothing I fear And I know that my heart will go on We'll stay forever this way You are safe
        in my heart and My heart will go on and on." Here, have the lyrics two more times: "Every night in my dreams I see you, I feel you That is how I know you go on Far across the distance And spaces between us You have come to show you go on Near,
        far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door And you're here in my heart And my heart will go on and on Love can touch us one time And last for a lifetime And never let go 'til we're gone Love was when
        I loved you One true time I'd hold to In my life we'll always go on Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door And you're here in my heart And my heart will go on and on You're here, there's nothing
        I fear And I know that my heart will go on We'll stay forever this way You are safe in my heart and My heart will go on and on." "Every night in my dreams I see you, I feel you That is how I know you go on Far across the distance And spaces between
        us You have come to show you go on Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door And you're here in my heart And my heart will go on and on Love can touch us one time And last for a lifetime And never
        let go 'til we're gone Love was when I loved you One true time I'd hold to In my life we'll always go on Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door And you're here in my heart And my heart will
        go on and on You're here, there's nothing I fear And I know that my heart will go on We'll stay forever this way You are safe in my heart and My heart will go on and on."</p>
