    <font color="ffff00">
      <p>The movie Heathers, which came out in 1989, featured actress Winona Ryder. The movie is rather messed, with the ethics of the main character, Veronica, being fudged a bit by her new boyfriend JD, who not sees no problem in killing someone and faking
        it as a suicide, but having the entire school sign a petition that (unbeknownst to them) actually discusses a suicide pact--a suicide pact that JD plans on making come true by blowing up the school during a pep rally. Overall, the movie is very
        good although it is also very messed up. Suicide and murder was a theme throughout the entirety of the movie. In the list below, I will discuss the different times death came up in the plot.</p>
    </font>
    <ul>
      <span style="color:ffff00">
        <li>Heather Chandler--murdered via drain killer disguised as "hangover cure" after threatening to ruin Veronica's reputation. JD convinced Veronia to write a fake suicide note.</li>
      </span>
      <span style="color:ffff00">
        <li>Kurt and Ram--murdered via gunshot after ruining Veronica's reputation. JD proceeded to convince Veronia to write a suicide note for them, one that claimed that they had made a suicide pact due to homophobia.</li>
      </span>
      <span style="color:ffff00">
        <li>Martha Dunnstock--tried to commit suicide via pinning a note to her shirt and walking traffic. Martha survived, but was then mocked for trying to "copy the cool kids".</li>
      </span>
      <span style="color:ffff00">
        <li>Heather McNamara--tried to overdose in the girls bathroom. She had previously admitted on a radio talk show that she was suffering from depression, something that the third Heather, Heather Duke, mocked her for. Veronica ended up saving her from
          overdosing.</li>
      </span>
        <span style="color:ffff00">
          <li>Veronica--fakes a suicide (via hanging) after she tells JD she won't participate in the killings anymore and he breaks into her room with a revolver.</li>
        </span>
        <span style="color:ffff00">
          <li>JD has the school sign a petition to get the band "Big Fun" to perform on campus. In reality, the paper is a mass suicide note. Veronica confronts JD while he is rigging explosives and ends up shooting him. JD stumbled out of the boiler room
            a couple of minutes later and disabled the bomb.</li>
        </span>
