      <font style="font-family:comicsans">
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size:8px;">This is the home page. It has all this random stuff on it and this paragraph is going to say nothing while being entirely too long. I don't know what to put here. Lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum lorem ipsum. On this website, we will discuss the fabulous
          movies "Heathers," "Edward Scissorhands," "Titanic," and "Beetlejuice." I'll be honest here, its been years since I've seen Edward Scissorhands and I don't remember most of it. Today is gonna be the day That they're gonna throw it back to you
          By now you should've somehow Realized what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do, about you now Backbeat, the word was on the street That the fire in your heart is out I'm sure you've heard it all before But you never
          really had a doubt I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do about you now And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding There are many things that I Would like to say to you but I don't
          know how Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me And after all, you're my wonderwall Today was gonna be the day But they'll never throw it back to you By now you should've somehow Realized what you're not to do I don't believe that
          anybody Feels the way I do, about you now And all the roads that lead you there are winding And all the lights that light the way are blinding There are many things that I Would like to say to you but I don't know how I said maybe, you're gonna
          be the one that saves me And after all, you're my wonderwall I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me And after all, you're my wonderwall I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me you're gonna be the one that saves me you're
          gonna be the one that saves me. Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go So make the best of this test and don't ask why It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time It's something
          unpredictable, but in the end it's right I hope you had the time of your life So take the photographs and still frames in your mind Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial For what it's worth
          it was worth all the while It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right I hope you had the time of your life It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right I hope you had the time of your life It's something unpredictable,
          but in the end it's right I hope you had the time of your life. Yeah You are my fire The one desire Believe when I say I want it that way But we are two worlds apart Can't reach to your heart When you say That I want it that way Tell me why
          Ain't nothin' but a heartache Tell me why Ain't nothin' but a mistake Tell me why I never want to hear you say I want it that way Am I, your fire? Your one, desire Yes I know, it's too late But I want it that way Tell me why Ain't nothin' but
          a heartache Tell me why Ain't nothin' but a mistake Tell me why, I never want to hear you say I want it that way Now I can see that we've fallen apart From the way that it used to be, yeah No matter the distance I want you to know That deep
          down inside of me You are my fire The one desire You are (you are, you are, you are) Don't want to hear you say Ain't nothin' but a heartache Ain't nothin' but a mistake (Don't want to hear you say) I never want to hear you say I want it that
          way Tell me why Ain't nothin' but a heartache Tell me why Ain't nothin' but a mistake Tell me why I never want to hear you say I want it that way Tell me why Ain't nothin' but a heartache Ain't nothin' but a mistake Tell me why I never want
          to hear you say (Never want to hear you say it) I want it that way 'Cause I want it that way</p>
