          <p>Edward Scissorhands, featuring Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, came out in 1990. In the movie, Edward Scissorhands is built by a scientist who dies before finishing building Edward. Edward is then taken home by some woman named Peg, and he then
            falls in love with her teenage daughter (honestly the age gap is sort of creepy, I looked it up and Johnny Depp was 27 or so, and Winona Ryder was only 18, this is a common theme in movies, men being far older than their partner. When both
            people have been an adult for a while an age gap isn't a problem, but when one of them is 18 and the other is nearly 10 years older, its creepy. It doesn't matter that this was a movie, it's creepy nontheless).</p>
